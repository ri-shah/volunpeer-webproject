        <h3>The Concept</h3>
        <p>Established in 2018 by co-workers Tracy, Rhiya and Aoise, our non-profit organisation Volunpeer; stemmed from a conversation about how ideal it would be to create an easily accessible platform for others, as well as ourselves to use when searching for places to volunteer at. 

Volunpeer has focused exclusively on creating a space that allows the public to volunteer wherever they'd like at just the click of a button. This is because whilst many may already know who/what organisation they'd like to volunteer at, others may not be as informed as others or may simply not have enough time to go to specific places based on their distance from the location.

Volunpeer aims to change all of that by enabling volunteers to input their post code in and see where exactly in their area they could be of assistance at!

Every member of our team has a unique story that brought them to Volunpeer. We've been consultants, teachers, activists and most importantly, volunteers! So we know exactly how rewarding it can be to help others, one way or another.

        <h3>Our Aim</h3>
        <p>Our Aim is to modernise and simplify the way in which Volunteering is done in today's world. Instead of going door to door asking whether anyone requires any assistance or contacting an organisation directly in order to find out whether they're looking for volunteers. Our plan is to get rid of all of that and by going online, minimising the timeframe of which you're able to find a suitable organisation to volunteer at. By doing so, our hope is that it creates an easier process for everyone, including the other organisations we work with and provide volunteers for.
