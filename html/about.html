        <h3>The Concept</h3>
        <p>< Established in 2018 by co-workers Tracy, Rhiya and Aoise, our non-profit organisation Volunpeer; stemmed from a conversation about how ideal it would be to create an easily accessible platform for others, as well as ourselves to use when searching for places to volunteer at. 

Volunpeer has focused exclusively on creating a space that allows the public to volunteer wherever they'd like at just the click of a button. This is because whilst many may already know who/what organisation they'd like to volunteer at, others may not be as informed as others or may simply not have enough time to go to specific places based on their distance from the location.

Volunpeer aims to change all of that by enabling volunteers to input their post code in and see where exactly in their area they could be of assistance at!

Every member of our team has a unique story that brought them to Volunpeer. We've been consultants, teachers, activists and most importantly, volunteers! So we know exactly how rewarding it can be to help others, one way or another.
